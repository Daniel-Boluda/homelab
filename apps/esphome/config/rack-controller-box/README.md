# Rack Controller

## Overview

Welcome to the Temperature Rack Controller README. This documentation guides you through assembling
and utilizing our controller for precision temperature management in rack-mounted environments.

## Components

- **Noctua NF-S12A PWM Fans:** Efficient and low-noise fans for optimal cooling.

- **ESP-WROOM-32 Microcontroller:** Powerful controller with Wi-Fi connectivity for remote
  monitoring.

- **OLED Display (128x64, I2C SSD1306):** High-resolution display for real-time temperature and
  system status.

- **Temperature Sensor (DHT22):** Accurate measurement of ambient temperature and humidity.

## Functionality

- **Temperature Monitoring:** Real-time temperature updates for informed decisions.

- **Fan Control:** Automatic control of Noctua fans with PID based on temperature readings or can be
  manually set to a specific speed.

- **Display Interface:** User-friendly OLED display for real time monitoring.
