This project utilizes [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
and [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops) to automate provisioning, operating, and
updating self-hosted services in my homelab. Based in [K3s](https://k3s.io/),
[ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and ZFS. It can be used as a highly customizable
framework to build your own homelab.

> **What is a homelab?**
>
> Homelab is a laboratory at home where you can self-host, experiment with new technologies,
> practice for certifications, and so on. For more information about homelab in general, see the

### üåê DNS

#### Load Balancer

[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) is configured in BGP mode, both on my router and within the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Ingress Controllers

For external access, port forwarding is configured for ports `80` and `443`, directing traffic to
the load balancer IP of the Kubernetes ingress controller.

There are also another ingress controller for internal use.

#### Internal DNS

To handle internal requests, DNS configuration redirects all subdomains under `k8s.grigri` to the internal ingress controller.

#### External DNS

[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in the cluster and
configured to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## ü§ù Thanks

Thanks to all folks who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/)
community. A lot of inspiration for my cluster came from those that have shared their clusters over
at [awesome-home-kubernetes](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/awesome-home-kubernetes).
